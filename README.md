## Model Architectures

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Input: 784 neurons
- Hidden Layers: 512, 256 (ReLU)
- Output: 10 neurons (Softmax)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: 10
- Accuracy: ~97–98%

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3) + MaxPooling
- Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3) + MaxPooling
- Dense: 128 neurons (ReLU)
- Output: 10 neurons (Softmax)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: 10
- Accuracy: ~98–99%

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | Baseline Error |
|------|---------|----------------|
| ANN  | ~97–98% | ~2.1% |
| CNN  | ~98–99% | ~0.97% |

CNN outperforms ANN due to better spatial feature extraction.
